Problem 1: The problem was that on line 249 in game_of_pointers_student1.cpp, they tried to assign
            invaders[invaderRow][invaderRow] instead of invaders[invaderRow][invaderCol]

Problem 2: On line 27 in game_of_pointers_student1 there is a semicolon after the first if 
            statement

Problem 3: In line 62 in game_of_pointers_student1, there is no statement for the for loop, so 
            the variable colIdx never changes, so it never satisfies the end loop condition

Problem 4: In line 218 of game_of_pointers_student2, it is deallocated as (n, m) instead of (m,n).
            It's supposed to be (m,n) because invaders is opposite of defenders

Problem 5: In ine 113 and 117 of game_of_pointers_student2, the student has the operations wrong,
            the student wrote that if defenders win, then logically defender loses, and vice versa.
